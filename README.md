# Floorish
This site was created to practice creating e-commerce sites. I used HTML, CSS, and some Javascript on the front-end. 
On the back-end I utilized PHP and MySQL to handle session-tracking, updating the shopping cart, and checking out. 

Domain to site has changed. Site is now live at floorish.herokuapp.com
